Welcome to my Weather Application! This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving weather statistics.

This is a passion project I'm using as an opportunity to become more familiar with ReactJS.
I'm developing base functionality for the application first before I go back over it with styles to make it responsive and aesthetically pleasing. 

Functionality allows for the user to search for current and forcasted weather based on city. The Javascript geolocation API is used to initialize the weather based on your current location. Weather stats include temperature (high, low), humidity, wind, and overall weather (rainy, cloudy, etc..). Daily weather cards may be clicked to toggle displaying the forecasted information for that day. 

Next, the plan is to continue adding styles in order to enhance look and increase responsiveness.

I will update this README as features/styles are added.
