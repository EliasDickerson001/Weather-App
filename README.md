Welcome to my Weather Application!

This is a passion project I'm using as an opportunity to become more familiar with ReactJS.
I'm developing base functionality for the application before I go back over it with styles and 
make it aesthetically pleasing. 

Functionality allows for the user to search for current weather based on city. Weather stats include 
temperature (high,low), humidity, wind, and overall weather (rainy, cloudy, etc..).

Forecast weather data retrieval and aggregation has been added. Forecasted weather will be represented by a DailyWeatherStats object. Next, the plan is to display the forecast data, then dress everything up with styles.

I will update this README as features/styles are added.
