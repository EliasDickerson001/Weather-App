Welcome to my Weather Application!

This is a passion project I'm using as an opportunity to become more familiar with ReactJS.
I'm developing base functionality for the application before I go back over it with styles and 
make it aesthetically pleasing. 

Functionality allows for the user to search for current weather based on city. Weather stats include 
temperature (high,low), humidity, wind, and overall weather (rainy, cloudy, etc..).

I will next be adding forecasted weather in addition to current weather. Then the plan is to dress everything up with styles.

I will update this README as features are added.
