Welcome to my Weather Application! This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving weather statistics.

This is a passion project I'm using as an opportunity to become more familiar with ReactJS.
I'm developing base functionality for the application first before I go back over it with styles and 
make it aesthetically pleasing. 

Functionality allows for the user to search for current and forcasted weather based on city. Weather stats include 
temperature (high, low), humidity, wind, and overall weather (rainy, cloudy, etc..).

-Forecast weather data retrieval and aggregation has been added. Forecasted weather will be represented by a DailyWeatherStats object. 
-Weather display cards have been started for displaying the forecasted weather, styling is in progress.
-A geolocation feature has been added where, upon application startup, it will retrieve weather information for the user's current location using the Javascript Geolocation API and OpenWeatherMap. 

Next, the plan is add the option of displaying every 3 hour increment of the forecast for a given day, and continue adding styles for appearance and responsiveness.

I will update this README as features/styles are added.
